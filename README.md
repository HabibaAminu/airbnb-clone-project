# airbnb-clone-project

This project is a full-stack clone of the popular accommodation booking platform AirBnB. The goal is to build a functional web application that allows users to browse property listings, view detailed property information, and complete bookings. The project will cover frontend development, backend APIs, database design, and deployment.

## UI/UX Design Planning

## Design Goals

The primary goal of the UI/UX design is to create an intuitive, aesthetically pleasing, and highly functional experience that mirrors the ease of use and visual appeal of leading booking platforms.

Simplicity & Clarity: Ensure the interface is clean, uncluttered, and easy to understand for all user types.

Consistency: Maintain a consistent visual language, interaction patterns, and branding across all pages.

Responsiveness: Optimize the design for seamless viewing and interaction across various devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).

Accessibility: Adhere to accessibility best practices (e.g., sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation) to ensure inclusivity.

Efficiency: Streamline user flows, especially for searching and booking, to minimize clicks and cognitive load.

Visual Appeal: Utilize modern design trends, high-quality imagery, and subtle animations to create an engaging experience.

## üé® UI/UX Design Planning

This section documents the key design properties used throughout the application. Having a defined set of design tokens ensures visual consistency, easier maintenance, and better collaboration between design and development.

### üß† Why This Matters

Defining design properties like colors and typography early in the project helps:

- ‚úÖ Maintain **visual consistency** across all components and pages
- ‚úÖ Simplify **collaboration** between developers and designers
- ‚úÖ Create a **scalable style system** for larger projects
- ‚úÖ Improve **code readability** and maintainability

These tokens are applied consistently in the CSS files and component styles across the frontend.
